# ðŸ”¢ Self-Directed Study Project â€” Discrete Mathematics

This repository documents my **self-directed study of Discrete Mathematics**, based primarily on **_Discrete Mathematics with Applications_** by **Susanna S. Epp** and the **in-class problems and problem sets** from **MITâ€™s 6.042J â€“ Mathematics for Computer Science** course (Open Learning Library).  

The purpose of this project is to build a rigorous understanding of the mathematical foundations used in **computer science, logic, and combinatorics**, while improving formal reasoning, proof-writing, and problem-solving skills.  

Here, I organize **notes, exercises, proofs, and project explorations** as I progress through the topics.

## Project Objectives

- Master core topics in **logic, proofs, sets, functions, relations, and combinatorics**.  
- Develop the ability to construct **formal mathematical proofs** with clarity and precision.  
- Strengthen understanding of **recurrence relations, graph theory, and number theory**.  
- Practice solving **MIT 6.042J in-class problems and problem sets** to apply concepts in context.  
- Build a long-term reference of **conceptual summaries, example problems, and written solutions**.
