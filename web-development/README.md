# Self-Directed Study Project — Web Development

This repository documents my **self-directed learning process in web development**, using **[Eloquent JavaScript (Marijn Haverbeke)](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)** and **[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/)** as my main study resources.  
The goal is to strengthen my understanding of **JavaScript, HTML, CSS**, and **best programming practices** through reading, note-taking, and hands-on projects.

## Project Goals

- Develop a deep understanding of **JavaScript fundamentals**.  
- Build fluency in **HTML** and **CSS** for creating pages and interfaces.  
- Practice **functional programming, object-oriented programming, and DOM manipulation**.  
- Build small **practical projects** based on the chapters of *Eloquent JavaScript*.  
- Record my progress and reflections throughout the learning journey.
