# ðŸ“˜ Self-Directed Study Project â€” Calculus in One Variable

This repository documents my **self-directed study of single-variable calculus**, following the book **_Calculus with Analytic Geometry_** by **George F. Simmons** and selected **problem sets from MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW)**.  
The goal of this project is to build a strong conceptual and computational foundation in calculus through reading, problem-solving, and reflection.  

Here, I record **summaries, solved exercises, proofs, and notes** as I progress through the topics of limits, derivatives, integrals, and applications.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a deep understanding of **limits, continuity, differentiation, and integration**.  
- Strengthen problem-solving and analytical reasoning skills through **MIT OCW problem sets**.  
- Connect **geometric intuition with analytical rigor** in calculus concepts.  
- Practice **derivation, proof, and application** of major theorems in single-variable calculus.  
- Maintain organized **notes and documented solutions** for long-term reference.
