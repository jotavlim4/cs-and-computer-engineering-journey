# Self-Directed Study Project — C / C++

This repository documents my **self-directed learning journey in C and C++ programming**.  
It serves as a personal workspace to explore language fundamentals, solve exercises, and build small projects inspired by the books **_Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++_** by Bjarne Stroustrup and **_The C Programming Language_** by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.  
The goal is to develop a solid understanding of both **procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms**, while strengthening problem-solving and software design skills.

## Project Objectives

- Master the **core syntax and semantics** of C and C++.  
- Understand **memory management**, **pointers**, and **data structures** at a low level.  
- Explore **modular design**, **abstraction**, and **object-oriented programming** principles.  
- Solve progressively complex exercises from both reference books.  
- Build small programs and experiments to reinforce theoretical concepts.  
- Document key insights, notes, and code samples throughout the study process.
